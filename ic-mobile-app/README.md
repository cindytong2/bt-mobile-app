- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   cd ic-mobile-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

### Running the App

After running `npx expo start`, you can run the app in several ways:

- **On your physical device**:
  1. Install the Expo Go app on your iOS or Android device
  2. Scan the QR code in the terminal with your phone's camera (iOS) or the Expo Go app (Android)

- **On iOS Simulator** (macOS only):
  - Press `i` in the terminal to open iOS simulator
  - Requires Xcode to be installed

- **On Android Emulator**:
  - Press `a` in the terminal to open Android emulator
  - Requires Android Studio to be installed

## ðŸ›  Development

- **Project Structure**:
  - `/app` - Main application code with file-based routing
  - `/components` - Reusable React components
  - `/constants` - App-wide constants and configuration
  - `/assets` - Images, fonts, and other static files

- **Common Commands**:
  ```bash
  # Start the development server
  npm start
  
  # Run on iOS simulator (macOS only)
  npm run ios
  
  # Run on Android emulator
  npm run android
  
  # Run on web
  npm run web
  ```

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
